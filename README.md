# Objective Ninja

Objective Ninja has a new home! 7 months since its initial release, Objective
Ninja as become an official plugin and ships with Binary Ninja by default. I ([@jonpalmisc](https://twitter.com/jonpalmisc))
will still be developing the plugin for the time being, but all further
development will continue on the [official plugin repo](https://github.com/Vector35/workflow_objc).

As a result, this repository has been archived. The [`master`](https://github.com/jonpalmisc/ObjectiveNinja/tree/master)
branch still contains the last revision of the Objective Ninja source code
before it was forked, for historical purposes.
